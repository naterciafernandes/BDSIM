% Function to simulate intermittent sensor faults (it applies to user defined bias, drift, scaling, stuck sensor, or loss of signal if sfaults.isIntermit is flagged on)


  function [a, b, signal] = intermittence (t, sfaults)


    nsensors = size (sfaults.a,2);
    ti = t(1);
    tf = t(end);
    dt = t(2) -t(1);
    lt = size (t, 2);

    a = sfaults.a;
    b = sfaults.b;
    signal = sfaults.signal;

    for k = 1 : nsensors                                            % for each sensor
       if (sfaults.isIntermit(k))                                   % if intermittence is on

          % generation of random intermittence periods
          tt = ti;
          while (tt < tf)
            tnew = tt +sfaults.tmaxInterm(k)*rand;
            tnew = min (tnew -mod (tnew, dt), tf);
            if (rand < 0.5)                                         % if rand is in the lower half
              %turning off the sensor fault
              ind1 = round ((  tt-ti)/dt +1);
