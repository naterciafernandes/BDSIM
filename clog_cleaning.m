% Function to simulate the cleaning of the oil filter


  function [r K2F K4F tclean] = clog_cleaning (t, p, pp, pfaults)


  % Time instant when the cleaning was performed
    tclean = t;

  % Update of the radius of the filter pores
    r = pp.rclean;

  % Adding consistent variability to the filter constants (new filter)
    aux1 = 4 * pp.visco / pi;
    aux2 = aux1 * pp.cv^2;
    aux1 = 2 * aux1;

    var = pfaults.filter_std * randn(1);

    K2F = p.K2F +aux2*var;
    K4F = p.K4F +aux1*var;


  end
