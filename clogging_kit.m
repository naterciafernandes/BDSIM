% Function to lump some parameters together for posterior numerical calculus


  function [K1F K2F K3F K4F] = clogging_kit (pp, pfaults)


    K1F = 1e12 * pfaults.clog_fraction / (2*pi*pp.zF*pp.np); % factor 1e12 => rp in micrometers
    K2F = 1e24 * 4 * pp.visco * pp.zF/(pp.np*pi) * pp.cv^2;  % factor 1e24 => rp in microm in Qoil
    K3F = pp.Ppump * pp.cv^2;
    K4F = 1e24 * 8*pp.visco * pp.zF / (pp.np *pi);           % factor 1e24 => rp in microm in DPfilter
